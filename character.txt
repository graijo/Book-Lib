Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human, who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omatikaya.[11][12]
Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite (Neytiri Sully), daughter of the previous clan chief, future Tsahìk of the clan, and Jake's mate.[11][12]
Sigourney Weaver as Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite (Kiri Sully), the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.[13] Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who took the side of the Na'vi and died during the conflict; her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and filmed scenes underwater.[14]
Weaver also reprises her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, despite Weaver's saying in 2014 that she would not do so, though she and Cameron confirmed prior to then that she would return in the sequels:[6][15][16] she appears in this film in a video recording and in a spiritual vision in which she meets with Kiri.
Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human military officer who led the paramilitary security division of the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.[17] After being killed by Neytiri in 2154, he is revived as a recombinant[17] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron said in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating, "I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga."[18][19] He later said Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.[20][21]
Lang also reprises his role as the original human Quaritch of the first movie in a video recording made for his recombinant self.
Kate Winslet as Ronal, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, who is pregnant.[22][23] Winslet called Ronal "a pivotal character in the ongoing story" but also "relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.[24] It marks her first time working with performance capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film; while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene shot underwater.[14][24][25][26]
Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband[27][28][29]
